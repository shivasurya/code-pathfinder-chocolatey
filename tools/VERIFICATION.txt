Package: code-pathfinder
Version: 1.1.1 (Python DSL: 1.1.1)

The binary is downloaded from the official GitHub Releases:
https://github.com/shivasurya/code-pathfinder/releases/tag/v1.1.1

Binary URL:
https://github.com/shivasurya/code-pathfinder/releases/download/v1.1.1/pathfinder-windows-amd64.exe

SHA256 Checksum:
e87ff9fef7ad10a34279aef5fdfd1e36de5b0e3e07bf3e2e849b36c9be35acc7

To verify the binary:
1. Download the exe from the URL above
2. Calculate SHA256 using one of these methods:
   - PowerShell: Get-FileHash pathfinder-windows-amd64.exe -Algorithm SHA256
   - Command Prompt: certutil -hashfile pathfinder-windows-amd64.exe SHA256
3. Compare with the checksum above

The installation script uses certutil for checksum verification during installation
for maximum compatibility across different Windows PowerShell versions.

Python Package:
The package also installs codepathfinder Python package (version 1.1.0) from PyPI
in an isolated virtualenv. The installation script downloads the wheel file first,
verifies the SHA256 checksum, and then installs from the verified wheel.

PyPI URL:
https://pypi.org/project/codepathfinder/1.1.1/

PyPI SHA256 Checksum (wheel file):
be9b9f359500bf35eeccdea5d377af29c8d6d80ddfd40095b25fdc90b93e83a6

To verify the PyPI package:
1. Download: pip download --no-deps codepathfinder==1.1.0
2. Calculate SHA256 of the downloaded .whl file
3. Compare with the checksum above

Security Notes:
- Binary is downloaded from official GitHub Releases (verified by Chocolatey's Get-ChocolateyWebFile)
- Python package is verified before installation (SHA256 checksum match required)
- Both checksums are hardcoded in chocolateyinstall.ps1 with marker comments for automation
- Fresh Python virtualenv is created on every install/upgrade for isolation
